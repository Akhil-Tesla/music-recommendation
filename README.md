Music-Recommendation-System

A machine learning-based music recommendation system utilizes advanced algorithms to analyze user preferences, song features, and historical data. Employing techniques like content-based filtering, and deep learning models, it provides relevant music recommendations, enhances user engagement and satisfaction on music streaming platforms. The aim of this project is to:

Generate a content-based music recommender system using a dataset of name, artist, and lyrics for 57650 songs in English obtained from Kaggle. The data has been acquired from LyricsFreak through scraping by the author.

Build a collaborative filtering music recommeder system using the Million Song Dataset; a freely-available collection of audio features and metadata for a million contemporary popular music tracks.

This repo is divided into the following two packages that contains the following files:

I. Content-based recommendation system:

a. A jupyter notebook named content_based_music_recommender that contains the code and analysis for the recommedation system. b. A CSV file named songdata containing the data for the songs used in the system.

II. Collaborative recommendation system:

a. A jupyter notebook named collaborative_music_recommender that contains the code and analysis for the recommedation system. b. A CSV file named songs containing the data for the songs used in the system.
